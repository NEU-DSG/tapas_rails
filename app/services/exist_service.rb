# ExistService
#
# This service connects to eXist to sync data while keeping the MySQL database
# as a single source of truth and allowing the application to take advantage
# of the extended capabilities of eXist
#
# Things that the Exist Service needs to be able to do
#  - Ask eXist-db for a MODS record generated from a given TEI file
#  - Ask eXist-db to perform a full record index
#    - Index given TEI File
#    - Return a TEIBP/Tapas Generic representations of the object
#    - Return the MODS metadata associated with this object
#  - Ask eXist-db to unindex a given record
